# Robotic_arm_Project
In this project, I used Python's scatter plot visualization to map the coverage area of a 2-link robotic arm. The goal was to form the letter 'M' by strategically selecting points within this area. The process involved meticulous manual point selection of the desired shape. Subsequently, I generated the corresponding joint angles for each chosen point. These angles will serve as input for the two servo motors, seamlessly translating the visualized 'M' into physical motion.
